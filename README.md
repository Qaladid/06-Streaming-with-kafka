### Module 6 - Streaming with Kafka
In this homework, I was practicing the expertise i got from module six, which was about streaming mainly in kafka but the questions i addressed are about streaming with PySpark.

Instead of Kafka, I used RedPanda, which is a drop-in replacement for Kafka.

instead of installing explicitly redpanda, i used a redpanda in docker container by just copying a docker-compose.yml file and then running docker-compose up. That way i leveraged redpanda's functionalities for distributed streaming platform that is compatible with the Apache Kafka ecosystem.
